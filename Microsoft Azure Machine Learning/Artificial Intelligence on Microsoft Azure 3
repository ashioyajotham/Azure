Machine learning is a technique that uses Mathematics and Statistics to create a model that can predict unknown values

Supervised - use historic data to predict models

    # Regression
     Features as x and labels as y ie f(x) = y

    # Classification
    Use categories to predict classes
    
  
  Unsupervised learning eg clusters
  
  
  **Process**
   Data ingestion
   Data cleaning
   Feature engineering
   
   
 # Using Azure Machine Learning
 After you have created an Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can use it to manage the various assets and resources you need to create machine learning solutions. 
 At its core, Azure Machine Learning is a platform for training and managing machine learning models, for which you need compute on which to run the training process. 
 -Create compute targets 
      *Compute targets are cloud-based resources on which you can run model training and data exploration processes. This is where you manage the compute targets for your data science activities. 
      There are four kinds of compute resource you can create: 
            Compute Instances: Development workstations that data scientists can use to work with data and models. 

           Compute Clusters: Scalable clusters of virtual machines for on-demand processing of experiment code. 

           Inference Clusters: Deployment targets for predictive services that use your trained models. 

           Attached Compute: Links to existing Azure compute resources, such as Virtual Machines or Azure Databricks clusters.
