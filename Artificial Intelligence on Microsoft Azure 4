Microsoft Azure Machine Learning includes an automated machine learning capability that leverages the scalability of cloud compute to automatically try multiple 
pre-processing techniques and model-training algorithms in parallel to find the best performing supervised machine learning model for your data. 

The automated machine learning capability in Azure Machine Learning supports supervised  machine learning models - in other words, models for which the training data includes known label values. You can use automated machine learning to train models for: 

          * Classification (predicting categories or classes) 

          * Regression (predicting numeric values) 

          * Time series forecasting (regression with a time-series element, enabling you to predict numeric values at a future point in time)

 In a residual histogram, residuals represent variance between predicted and true values that cannot be explained by the model
