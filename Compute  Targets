// To train and deploy models using Azure Machine Learning designer, you need compute targets to run the training process. 
    You will also use these compute targets to test the trained model after its deployment.

// Compute targets are cloud-based resources on which you can run model training and data exploration processes.
   * Compute Instances: Development workstations that data scientists can use to work with data and models.
   * Compute Clusters: Scalable clusters of virtual machines for on-demand processing of experiment code.
   * Inference Clusters: Deployment targets for predictive services that use your trained models.
  * Attached Compute: Links to existing Azure compute resources, such as Virtual Machines or Azure Databricks clusters.
