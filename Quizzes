 You must create a compute target for training experiments that require a graphical processing unit (GPU). 
 You want to be able to scale the compute so that multiple nodes are started automatically as required. Which kind of compute target should you create?

                 Use a compute cluster to create multiple nodes of GPU-enabled VMs that are started automatically as needed.
                 

Which metric presents the ratio of correct predictions (true positives + true negatives) to the total number of predictions? Precision


You use an Azure Machine Learning designer pipeline to train and test a binary classification model. You review the model's performance metrics in an Evaluate Model module, and note that it has an AUC score of 0.6. What can you conclude about the model?

        The model performs better than random guessing
        
        
  Accuracy - 


You create a machine learning experiment based on a clustering model. Now you want to use the model in an inference pipeline. Which module should you use to infer cluster predictions from the model?
     Assign data to clusters
     
     

Suppose you are testing a K-Means clustering model. If you would want your model to assign items to one of four clusters, which parameter/property should you configure on the module?
      Set number of centroids to 4

What are two correct guidelines to get the best results when using a custom model for Form Recognizer service?
  Images must be JPEG, PNG, BMP, PDF, or TIFF formats
 For PDF documents, no larger than 17 inches x 17 inches

Azure Form Recognizer - extract text, key/value pairs, and table data automatically from scanned documents.
