 You must create a compute target for training experiments that require a graphical processing unit (GPU). 
 You want to be able to scale the compute so that multiple nodes are started automatically as required. Which kind of compute target should you create?

                 Use a compute cluster to create multiple nodes of GPU-enabled VMs that are started automatically as needed.
